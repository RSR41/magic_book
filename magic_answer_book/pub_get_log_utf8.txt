Because magic_answer_book
 depends on flutter_local
izations from sdk which d
epends on intl 0.19.0, in
tl 0.19.0 is required.
So, because magic_answer_
book depends on intl ^0.2
0.2, version solving fail
ed.


You can try the following
 suggestion to make the p
ubspec resolve:
* Consider downgrading yo
ur constraint on intl: fl
utter pub add intl:^0.19.
